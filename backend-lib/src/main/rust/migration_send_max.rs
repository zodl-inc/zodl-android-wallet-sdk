//! Orchard to Ironwood pool migration.
//!
//! The generic capability this builds on lives upstream:
//! [`propose_send_max_transfer`] already spends the entire spendable balance of
//! a caller-chosen set of shielded pools to a single recipient, computing the
//! fee so that nothing is left over. This module does not reimplement any of
//! that, nor does it expose the general form. It pins every parameter that
//! makes the call a migration, and that single instance is all the SDK offers.
//!
//! The "no remainder" property is the reason a migration needs send-max rather
//! than an ordinary transfer: the caller cannot compute the right amount
//! themselves, because the fee depends on which inputs the selector picks.

/// Ironwood needs no address type of its own: it shares the Orchard receiver
/// encoding, and once Ironwood is active `zcash_client_backend` represents a
/// payment to an Orchard receiver as an Ironwood-pool output, which the
/// transaction builder places in the Ironwood bundle. Sending the maximum from
/// Orchard to the account's own internal Orchard receiver is therefore exactly
/// the pool crossing, with nothing left behind in Orchard.
///
/// Uses [`MaxSpendMode::Everything`], so the proposal fails rather than
/// migrating only part of the balance. `MaxSpendable` would silently skip any
/// Orchard note that is not yet spendable (`zcash_client_sqlite` maps the two
/// modes to `Ok(None)` and `Err(IneligibleNotes)` respectively for such a
/// note), leaving funds in a pool the wallet is trying to leave and reporting
/// success. The eligibility check covers only the pools being spent, so an
/// unconfirmed Sapling note does not block this.
///
/// Fails if NU6.3 is not yet active. Before activation the identical call is
/// still accepted by the input selector, but it constructs an *Orchard*-pool
/// output rather than an Ironwood one (`input_selection.rs` picks the pool on
/// `ironwood_active_at`), so it would be a self-send that migrates nothing and
/// costs a fee. Refusing beats silently doing that.
///
/// **This is not a private migration.** It produces one transaction whose
/// value is the account's entire Orchard balance, which any observer can read
/// off the chain. Splitting a crossing into less-identifying denominations is
/// a separate mechanism; this deliberately does not attempt it.
