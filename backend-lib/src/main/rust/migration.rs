//! JNI bindings for the migration engine.
//!
//! Rewired (2026-07-21) from our own hand-rolled `zcash_pool_migration` crate onto the core/
//! upstream `zcash_pool_migration` crate plus `zcash_client_sqlite::pool_migration`
//! (Danny/core team, `zcash/librustzcash` PR #2669 + stack; the SQLite persistence side was later
//! folded from a standalone `zcash_pool_migration_sqlite` crate into `zcash_client_sqlite` proper).
//! See `migration_engine.rs` for the adapter wiring our wallet DB into the new engine's traits, and
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-current-migration-implementation-spec.md` (zashi-android
//! repo) for the full gap analysis this rewire is based on.
//!
//! Every JNI function here keeps its original signature and JNI-visible behavior so no Kotlin
//! code needed to change — the engine swap is entirely internal to this file and
//! `migration_engine.rs`. Two known, deliberate deviations from the old crate's exact semantics:
//!
//! 1. The new engine's `Schedule` type has no `anchor_height` (ZIP 374 defers anchor selection to
//!    proving time, not planning time) — `JniTransferProposal.anchorHeight` is populated with the
//!    schedule's `broadcast_height()` as a placeholder so the Kotlin type doesn't need to change;
//!    it no longer carries a real commitment-tree anchor value. Callers must not treat it as one.
//! 2. `finalizeReadyTransfersNative` and `nextDueTransferNative` prove transactions ahead of
//!    broadcast (ZIP 374) via `try_prove` (see its doc comment), which wraps
//!    `zcash_pool_migration`'s own `WalletMigrationProver`/`engine::prove_transfer`/
//!    `prove_preparation` — adopted 2026-07-23, replacing this file's former hand-ported
//!    `migration_finalize.rs` stopgap (removed) now that core provides the equivalent built-in.
//! 3. Plan details never cross the JNI boundary inward. Each `propose*`/`prepare*` call caches
//!    its plan Rust-side under an opaque `PlanHandle` (returned to Kotlin as the proposal
//!    object's `proposalHandle` field, for display alongside the schedule), and the commit
//!    functions (`signNoteSplitNative`, `signAndStoreMigrationScheduleNative`,
//!    `createUnsignedNoteSplitPcztNative`, `createUnsignedTransferPcztsNative`) take ONLY that
//!    handle back — `commit_or_reuse`/`migration_plan_cache` then sign exactly the identified
//!    plan or error if it was superseded by a later proposal. (Rebuilding a plan from
//!    caller-echoed primitives is impossible anyway: the new engine's plan types have no public
//!    constructor — verified directly, not assumed.)

/// Commits and signs the WHOLE migration (split + every transfer) in one pass via
/// `commit_preparation` — the new engine has no partial/staged commit — matching the ZIP 318
/// "sign now, prove later" contract our old crate also used (see
/// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-migration-sign-now-prove-later-design.md` in zashi-android).
/// The split's own transaction is then finalized (proved) and extracted immediately, synchronously,
/// so this function can return a `PreparedTransfer` the caller broadcasts right away — matching the
/// old JNI contract exactly. The remaining transfer transactions are left `Signed` in the store for
/// `MigrationWorker`'s normal `finalizeReadyTransfersNative`/`nextDueTransferNative` loop to pick up
/// later, once they're actually due.
///
/// The split is a preparation transaction: even though it spends an already-witnessed wallet note
/// directly, ZIP 374 still defers its Orchard anchor/witness to proving time like any other
/// migration transaction (see `try_prove`'s doc comment) — `finalize_note_split` resolves that
/// against the wallet's current natural anchor.

/// every never-broadcast transaction's note reservation (so the notes return to DEFAULT note
/// selection immediately, not at lock expiry), then moves the record to the terminal `Cancelled`
/// status — in that order, in one database transaction, so a crash between the two leaves a
/// still-pending migration that a retried call finishes.
///
/// Supersedes this function's earlier manual "status-only swap to `Failed`" implementation — the
/// accepted residual from when the engine had no real cancel primitive. That older version left
/// `getMigrationStateNative` reporting `RequiresAttention` (as after any failure) rather than
/// `NotStarted`, since the record stayed stored under a non-`Cancelled` status. This version's
/// `Cancelled` status is NOT one `derive_migration_state`'s `is_terminal()` match arms names
/// explicitly — falling through its `unreachable!()` would be a real bug — but `get_migration()`
/// itself reports `None` once cancelled (verified in PR #2926's own end-to-end test:
/// `get_migration` reports `None` while `latest_migration` still reads back `Cancelled` for
/// history), so `derive_migration_state`'s `let Some(state) = persisted else { return NotStarted }`
/// short-circuits before ever reaching that match — the same clean `NotStarted` a subsequent
/// propose/commit call plans fresh over the full released balance from, matching what this app's
/// own `RestartMigrationUseCase` doc has always promised ("the home banner returns to a clean
/// 'Migrate now'") but which the old implementation didn't actually deliver.
///
/// Calling with no pending migration performs only the REPAIR half: releasing a stranded lock on
/// the latest retained record (e.g. one an older client left `Failed`) without rewriting its
/// status — see `PoolMigrations::cancel_migration`'s own doc. Also works WITHOUT deserializing the
/// migration state, and is honest about what it cannot undo: an already-broadcast transaction may
/// still mine (the returned `CancelOutcome` reports `in_flight`/`mined` rather than refusing — not
/// yet surfaced to Kotlin by this entry point, which only reports whether anything was released).
///
/// Returns 1 if any note reservation was released (an in-progress run was cancelled, or a stranded
/// terminal-record lock was repaired), 0 if there was nothing to release.

// `read_invalidation`, `clear_invalidation`, and the state-mutation logic that
// `recordTransferResultNative` (tags 2|3) now exercises.
//
// The JNI portion of the flow — `derive_migration_state` constructing Java
// objects (`JniAttentionReason$InvalidTransfer` / `$TransferExpired`) — cannot
// be driven from a pure `cargo test` run (no JVM).  It is compile-verified:
// the function signature change (extra `&Connection` + `&[u8]` params) ensures
// incorrect callers fail at compile time, and the `env.new_object(...)` calls
// carry the right constructor signatures in string literals that are checked at
// JNI call time during device/emulator tests.
