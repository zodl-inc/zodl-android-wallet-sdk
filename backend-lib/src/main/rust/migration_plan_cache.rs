//! In-process cache of the most recent `MigrationPlan` per account, bridging the gap between
//! `plan_migration()` (a pure, unpersisted preview — see its doc comment) and the commit
//! functions (`commit_preparation`/`build_preparation_unsigned`) that need that exact same plan
//! value later.
//!
//! Every cached plan is identified by an opaque, randomly drawn [`PlanHandle`], returned to the
//! caller alongside the plan and carried through the JNI proposal objects
//! (`JniNoteSplitProposal.proposalHandle`/`JniMigrationSchedule.proposalHandle`). A commit call
//! passes the handle back, and [`get`] refuses to release a plan under any other handle — so a
//! commit can only ever sign the exact plan the caller was shown, never one that a later
//! `propose*`/`prepare*` call happened to cache in the meantime (ZIP 318's scheduling draws fresh
//! randomness on every `plan_migration()` call, so two plans essentially never agree even with
//! unchanged wallet state; without the handle gate this was a real sign-what-the-user-never-saw
//! hazard).
//!
//! Unlike this file's neighbors, this is NOT backed by the wallet SQLite database: the new
//! engine's `MigrationPlan` (and its `DenominationPlan`/`PreparationPlan` fields) has no `serde`
//! support and no public constructor — the only way to obtain one is calling `plan_migration()`
//! itself (verified directly against `zcash_pool_migration`'s source, not assumed), so it
//! can't be round-tripped through our own persistence the way `migration_finalize`'s proven-pczt
//! cache was. Instead this holds it in memory, in a process-lifetime static — valid because the
//! app's entire "review a migration proposal, then confirm/sign it" flow happens on one screen, in
//! one app-process lifetime (confirmed with the user), never across a process restart.
