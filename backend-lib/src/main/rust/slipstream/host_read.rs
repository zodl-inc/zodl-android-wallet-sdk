//! `host_read` — the 5 typed production host-read exports (FFI_JNI_CONTRACT.md §2/§4.2/§9.3),
//! replacing the JSON `readQuery` lane (`read_query.rs`, now debug-only) as
//! `SlipstreamTransactionReader`'s read path. Each export constructs `com.zodl.slipstream.model`
//! objects field-by-field — the same JNI-constructs-objects rule §4.1 already uses for
//! `snapshot`/`walletSummary` — instead of crossing a JSON string. SQL text below was moved
//! VERBATIM from the Kotlin reader it replaces (no query rewritten in the port), except
//! `listTransactions`' projection, which since 2026-08-03 also selects `zip318_kind` (see
//! [`has_zip318_kind_column`] — the column librustzcash's not-yet-released zip318-classification
//! work adds to `v_transactions`; degrades to a literal `0` when absent) — appended as the LAST
//! column/ctor arg so the JNI binding contract's existing field order stays untouched.
//!
//! Connections are opened via `read_query::open_read_only` — the same bundled rusqlite
//! instance the engine's own writer uses (`SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY`, `busy_timeout` 5 s; see
//! that module's doc comment for why sharing the instance matters). Row loops build their
//! owned Rust values first, then construct the JNI array/objects in a second pass inside
//! `env.with_local_frame` per row (bounds the local-reference table; `summary.rs`'s per-account
//! loop only warns about this — this is the port that actually does it).
