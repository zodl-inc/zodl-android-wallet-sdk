# Changelog
All notable changes to this library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this library adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `TransactionEncoderException.InsufficientFundsException` is thrown - by both the upstream and the
  Slipstream engine - when a proposal cannot be created because the account lacks the spendable funds
  to cover the requested amount together with its fee. It replaces
  `ProposalFromParametersException`/`ProposalFromUriException`/`ProposalShieldingException` for that
  specific failure, so callers no longer have to match on the Rust layer's error message (MOB-1723,
  #680).
- `PcztException.MultiStepProposalUnsupportedException` is thrown by `createPcztFromProposal` when the
  given proposal needs more than one transaction. Only TEX (ZIP-320) payments produce such proposals,
  so this is what a caller sees when it tries to pay a TEX address with an external signer (MOB-1723).

### Changed
- The Slipstream engine's `proposeTransfer`, `proposeFulfillingPaymentUri`, `proposeShielding` and
  `proposeOrchardToIronwoodMigration` now report failures with the same `TransactionEncoderException`
  subtypes the upstream engine uses, instead of letting the raw Rust `RuntimeException` escape
  (MOB-1723).

### Fixed
- All JNI entry points now convert caller-supplied numeric arguments (network ids, the UTXO
  output index, Tor dormant mode) with checked conversions instead of unchecked casts, so
  out-of-range values fail with an exception instead of silently wrapping (MOB-1764).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- Shielded voting: `voteSubmission(roundId, bundleIndex, proposalId)` returns `JniVoteSubmission`,
  the chain-ready fields needed to resend a cast-vote transaction before it confirms, without the
  helper-share payloads that go stale once the tree position is recorded.
- Shielded voting: `recordVcPosition(roundId, bundleIndex, proposalId, vcTreePosition)` records
  the confirmed position of the vote commitment in the vote commitment tree.
- New artifact `cash.z.ecc.android:zcash-android-sdk-slipstream`. The Slipstream sync engine, which
  used to live inside `zcash-android-sdk` under the `com.zodl.slipstream` package, is now its own
  Gradle module (`:slipstream-lib`) and its own published library. Consumers of
  `zcash-android-sdk-incubator` get it transitively at runtime scope and need no explicit
  dependency; the package names are unchanged, so direct `com.zodl.slipstream` call sites keep
  compiling once the artifact is on the classpath. The engine module compiles against
  `zcash-android-sdk`'s `internal` declarations through a Kotlin friend-module relationship, so the
  two artifacts are version-locked siblings and must always be used at matching versions.
- New Gradle property `IS_SLIPSTREAM_ENABLED` (default `true`) decides at SDK build time whether a
  build carries Slipstream at all. With it set to `false`, `:slipstream-lib` is not configured, the
  `slipstream` Cargo feature is off — so `libzcashwalletsdk.so` carries no
  `Java_com_zodl_slipstream_*` exports — nothing Slipstream is published, and `WalletCoordinator`
  drives the classic `Synchronizer`.

### Changed
- Updated the `zcash_voting` dependency to `2.0.0-rc.5` 
- **Shielded voting works again, on a source-incompatible API.** 2.8.0-rc.1 shipped with the
  voting module switched off and `VotingRustBackend` deprecated at `ERROR` level; the module is
  built into the native library again and that deprecation is removed, so `VotingRustBackend` and
  the `sdk-lib` typesafe wrapper around it are usable. The surface is not the one that existed
  before 2.8.0-rc.1, because it is now built on `zcash_voting` 2.0.0-rc.3: the native entry points
  went from 60 to 55, because three were added and eight were removed — seven of them public API,
  the eighth a test fixture — and nine of the survivors changed their parameter lists, one of them
  without changing its signature. A wallet that stayed on a pre-2.8 release to keep voting working
  should expect to revisit every voting call site, and cannot carry a round's existing state across
  the upgrade — in particular, hotkeys created by an earlier SDK version do not carry over,
  because they were derived from the wallet seed and hotkeys no longer are. The entries below
  enumerate the delta.
- **Shielded voting: hotkeys are no longer derived from the wallet seed, and the application must
  persist them.** `VotingRustBackend.VotingDb.generateHotkey` now takes a network id instead of a
  seed and returns `JniVotingHotkey(storedSecret, rawOrchardAddress, addressIndex)`. A voting
  hotkey is app-owned random material generated inside `zcash_voting`, so every call returns a
  different one and **`storedSecret` cannot be recovered or re-derived from anything else** — not
  from the wallet seed phrase, not from the wallet database, not from the chain. Consequences a
  wallet must design around:
  - The application must store `storedSecret` in platform secure storage, keyed by round, before
    the delegation transaction is broadcast, and hand it back to `buildGovernancePczt`,
    `buildGovernancePcztFromSeed`, `buildAndProveDelegation`, `commitVote` and
    `deriveHotkeyRawAddress` for the rest of the round.
  - **Restoring a wallet from its seed phrase does not restore the ability to vote** in a round
    whose hotkey secret was not separately backed up.
  - **Losing `storedSecret` forfeits the voting power already delegated to that hotkey** for the
    round; the delegation cannot be reissued to a new hotkey.
  `JniVotingHotkey.toString()` is redacted so the secret cannot reach a log through string
  interpolation or the generated `data class` rendering. Its constructor and `copy()` are now
  public, where the `HotkeyPublicKey` type it replaces restricted both: the length validation that
  guards hotkey material lives in the `sdk-lib` wrapper around `generateHotkey`, and that wrapper's
  tests are in a different Gradle module, so they cannot fabricate the malformed hotkey the check
  exists to reject unless the constructor is public. Constructing a `JniVotingHotkey` grants no
  capability, because every native entry point takes the raw `storedSecret` bytes rather than this
  carrier.
- Shielded voting: `JniNoteInfo`, `JniSharePayload` and `JniShareDelegationRecord` now redact their
  `toString()`, as `JniVotingHotkey`, `JniVoteCommitResult` and `JniVoteSubmission` already did.
  The generated `data class` rendering would otherwise print note spending randomness and a full
  unified viewing key, a vote commitment's primary blind, and a share nullifier into any log line
  that interpolates one of them.
- Shielded voting: `JniRoundState.hotkeyAddress` and `JniRoundState.delegatedWeight` are now
  always `null`. `zcash_voting` does not populate either field, so a caller that reads the hotkey
  address from the round state reads null regardless of what hotkey generation did. Recover the
  address with `deriveHotkeyRawAddress` from the persisted `storedSecret`, and read the delegated
  weight from the bundle weights `setupBundles` returned.
- Shielded voting: a vote is "submitted" by having a recorded transaction hash rather than by a
  separate flag. `storeVoteTxHash` and `markVoteSubmitted` collapsed into a single
  conflict-checked `markVoteSubmitted(roundId, bundleIndex, proposalId, txHash)`. Recording the
  same hash twice is idempotent; recording a *different* hash for a vote that already has one now
  **fails** instead of silently overwriting, so a wallet keeps polling the transaction it
  originally submitted.
- Shielded voting: `buildVoteCommitment`, `signCastVote` and `buildSharePayloads` collapsed into a
  single `commitVote`, which builds, signs and stores the commitment and returns the helper-share
  payloads on `JniVoteCommitResult.sharePayloads`. `JniVoteCommitmentResult` is renamed to
  `JniVoteCommitResult`; it no longer carries `voteRoundId`, `sharesHash`, `shareBlinds`,
  `shareComms` or `alphaV`, and it gains `voteAuthSig` and `sharePayloads`. Of the five dropped
  fields, `shareBlinds` and `alphaV` stop crossing the JNI boundary altogether — that recovery
  material is owned by `zcash_voting` now. The other three merely moved: `sharesHash` and
  `shareComms` are on `JniSharePayload`, and `voteRoundId` is on `JniVoteSubmission`.
- Shielded voting: `getDelegationSubmission` now takes a caller-supplied `spendAuthSig` (64 bytes)
  over the ZIP-244 `sighash` (32 bytes), and `getDelegationSubmissionWithKeystoneSig` is removed.
  Software and hardware signing have converged: `zcash_voting` no longer derives account keys or
  signs, so every signer hands back a signature.
- Shielded voting: `initRound` takes a `networkId` and binds the round to that network, and a
  round id must be 64 lowercase hex characters encoding a canonical Pallas field element.
  `buildGovernancePczt`, `buildGovernancePcztFromSeed` and `buildAndProveDelegation` take
  `hotkeyStoredSecret` in place of `hotkeyRawAddress` / `hotkeySeed`, and `buildAndProveDelegation`
  additionally takes `fvkBytes`, `seedFingerprint`, `accountIndex` and `roundName`, because the
  only public constructor for the delegation keys requires the whole hotkey.
- **Shielded voting: `deriveHotkeyRawAddress(ByteArray, Int)` kept its signature and changed its
  meaning.** The first parameter was `hotkeySeed`, derived from the wallet seed; it is now
  `hotkeyStoredSecret`, the app-owned random secret `generateHotkey` returns. Because the
  signature is byte-identical, **every existing call site compiles unchanged**, and a compiler
  error will not point at this one. Worse, it does not fail at run time either: a BIP-39 seed is
  64 bytes and the stored secret is required to be 64 bytes, so a wallet that keeps passing its
  wallet seed is accepted without error, silently returns the address of a hotkey nobody
  delegated to, and turns the wallet seed into per-round hotkey material held in whatever storage
  the caller used for a value that was previously derivable. Audit every `deriveHotkeyRawAddress`
  call by hand and pass the persisted `storedSecret`.
- Shielded voting: `recordShareDelegation` no longer takes a `nullifier`; it is derived natively
  from the vote's own recovery state.
- Shielded voting: `setupBundles` rejects an empty note set instead of returning a zero-bundle
  result.
- Shielded voting: `getCommitmentBundle` returns null until the vote is confirmed — its
  transaction hash recorded via `markVoteSubmitted` *and* its vote-commitment tree position
  recorded via the new `recordVcPosition` — and for a vote that was never stored. Use the new
  `voteSubmission` for a pre-confirmation resend, then `recordVcPosition`, then
  `getCommitmentBundle` for fresh helper-share payloads.

### Removed
- Shielded voting: `decomposeWeight`, `buildSharePayloads`, `signCastVote`, `buildVoteCommitment`,
  `storeCommitmentBundle`, `storeVoteTxHash` and `getDelegationSubmissionWithKeystoneSig`, along
  with the `HotkeyPublicKey` type and `JNI_HOTKEY_PUBLIC_KEY_BYTES_SIZE` (replaced by
  `JNI_HOTKEY_STORED_SECRET_BYTES_SIZE` and `JNI_ORCHARD_RAW_ADDRESS_BYTES_SIZE`). The underlying
  `zcash_voting` entry points are either gone or no longer public; the `### Changed` entries above
  say what replaces each one.
- **Breaking for `zcash-android-sdk-incubator` consumers:** `WalletCoordinator`'s
  `isSlipstreamEnabled` constructor parameter is gone. Which sync engine backs the coordinator is
  now decided when the SDK is built, by `IS_SLIPSTREAM_ENABLED`, rather than by the calling
  application at runtime. Applications that passed `isSlipstreamEnabled = true` should drop the
  argument and consume an SDK build that has the flag on (the default); applications that passed
  `false`, or relied on the parameter's `false` default, need an SDK build with the flag off.

### Fixed
- The native library no longer links two copies of the Zcash crate graph (#2056). `zcash_voting`
  moved from its crates.io `=0.11.0` pin to `2.0.0-rc.3`. The old pin
  required the pre-Ironwood librustzcash family, which cargo resolved *alongside* this crate's
  Ironwood family, so every build carried two copies each of `orchard`, `pczt`, `shardtree`,
  `zcash_address`, `zcash_keys`, `zcash_primitives`, `zcash_protocol` and `zcash_transparent`.
  Each of those now resolves exactly once. Duplicated crates are not merely wasted space in the
  shipped `.so`: two copies of a crate are unrelated types to the compiler, so a value that crosses
  between voting and the rest of the wallet as bytes rather than as a Rust type — a note
  commitment, a nullifier — compiles cleanly while feeding one `orchard` generation's output into
  another's circuit. That hazard is why voting was switched off in 2.8.0-rc.1 rather than simply
  rebuilt, and removing it is what allows it back on.
- Resubmission no longer permanently drops a pending submit plan for a wallet-created transaction
  missing from the derived history view: the wallet store is consulted before pruning - the plan
  is kept while the transaction exists and is unexpired (or expiry-disabled), and kept when the
  store read is inconclusive (MOB-1717).
- A transaction whose raw bytes cannot be read during resubmission is skipped and retried next
  sync cycle instead of aborting the sync pass with `TransactionNotFoundException` (MOB-1717).
- Slipstream's post-create transaction readback reads the `transactions` base table instead of
  `v_transactions`, so sending/shielding no longer fails when the history view has not projected
  the newly created transaction (MOB-1717).

## [3.0.2] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- A newly created transaction now becomes visible in `Synchronizer.allTransactions` on the next
  engine tick (~2 s) instead of only after its network broadcast round-trip resolves: the
  Slipstream broadcaster pokes the engine's transaction-change signal at store time in both
  `createProposedTransactions` and `createTransactionFromPczt`, in addition to the existing
  submit-time poke. Under a degraded network the submit-time-only poke left a sent transaction
  invisible in the Activity list for the whole multi-endpoint submit window (MOB-1584).
- Migration Keystone batch signing no longer stalls for seconds when building the first note-split
  PCZT of a run: spendable-note selection is now cached for the lifetime of one migration call
  instead of being re-queried from the wallet database on every note the plan spends (MOB-1669).
- Spendable balance no longer stays pinned at zero indefinitely (with a correct total balance and a
  `SYNCED` status) after an Orchard→Ironwood migration (MOB-1667). Three defects chained into that
  state, and all three are fixed:
  - the `readyToBroadcast` leg of the migration sync block had no time bound, unlike the other two
    legs. Its escape - the plan's stale-plan expiry - is evaluated against the scanned tip, which
    only advances while sync runs, so a migration driver that never ran again (a background worker
    killed by an aggressive OEM scheduler) paused sync forever. It is now capped at three privacy
    sync buffers of continuous readiness, re-armed by every live transfer attempt;
  - `Synchronizer.pause()` stopped the engine's poll loop, which performs only local reads and
    never gated the network session it was supposed to decorrelate; the pause therefore froze the
    balances, heights and status the host renders - and forced `status` to `SYNCED` while they were
    frozen. Pausing now suppresses `syncBurst` and transaction resubmission only, keeps polling, and
    reports the engine's real status. `resume()` restarts an engine a preceding `onBackground()`
    stopped instead of polling a dead session;
  - the stale-tip spendable mask now fails open after 15 minutes of consecutive stale ticks. It
    could otherwise never lift, because the engine's `tipFresh` flag latches only when a full
    network prologue completes. Showing spendable against an unverified tip cannot lose funds - a
    spend built on a stale tip fails at propose or broadcast.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-08-08

### Changed
- `OrchardMigrationSdk` external-signing APIs now carry PCZTs as `Pczt` instead of raw
  `ByteArray`, including `KeystoneBatchSignedPczts` and `UnsignedPreparationPczt`; callers must
  wrap signer output in `Pczt` and use `Pczt.toByteArray()` when sending it to external devices.
- `TransferResult.Success.txId` is now `TransactionId` instead of `String`; callers that need the
  display encoding must use `TransactionId.txIdString()`.

### Fixed
- `ImportAccountCheckpointsNotReadyException` and Slipstream account-loading logs no longer expose
  backend exception details that could contain sensitive wallet input.
- Transaction status no longer flickers back to Pending during a synchronizer rebuild (e.g. an
  automatic server switch) - restored the DB-backed chain-height fallback the legacy synchronizer
  had for this gap, which was dropped when this path was ported to the Slipstream engine.
- Expired transactions with no `block_time` (never mined) now get an estimated timestamp from the
  block-height gap to the chain tip, instead of a null timestamp that sorted the transaction as if
  it happened at the end of today regardless of how long ago it actually expired.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- `CompactBlockProcessor.enhanceTransactionDetails` and the per-transaction `enhanceTransaction`
  step now emit structured diagnostic logs at each step of an enhance cycle — cycle start with
  request count, per-request type, fetch response shape (whether a tx was returned, whether it
  has a mined height), the decision taken (`setTransactionStatus` or `decryptAndStoreTransaction`),
  per-request errors with error type, and cycle completion. Logs use opaque per-request
  correlation ids (no transaction ids, addresses, or other PII) so production logs are debuggable
  for future stuck-transaction reports without exposing user-identifying data.
- `TransactionOverview.spentNoteCount`, the number of the account's own notes the
  transaction spent.
- `TransactionOverview.poolCrossingValue`, the value that crossed shielded pools when
  the transaction is a wallet-internal transfer between them, such as an Orchard to
  Ironwood migration, and `null` when it is not one. For such a transaction
  `TransactionOverview.netValue` is only the fee, so this is the amount to present to
  a user rather than the balance delta.
- `TransactionOverview.isTrusted`, whether the transaction's outputs become spendable
  after the trusted confirmation count rather than the untrusted one.
- `TransactionOverview.zip318Kind`, a new `Zip318Kind` reporting how a transaction
  classifies against ZIP 318, the Orchard to Ironwood pool migration.
  `Zip318Kind.NOT_CLASSIFIED` means the wallet has not looked at the transaction,
  not that the transaction is not a migration, and warrants no label in a UI; a
  transaction the wallet has examined and rejected is `NONCONFORMING` instead. Only
  `PREPARATION` and `TRANSFER` are the wallet's own migration. Transactions already
  in the wallet's history are not classified retroactively on upgrade: they read
  `NOT_CLASSIFIED` until rescanned.
- The four properties above are new `TransactionOverview` constructor parameters, so
  positional construction will not compile until all of them are supplied; named
  construction needs no edit.

### Changed
- Updated the librustzcash crates to `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.7` and
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.7`, adopting the revised ZIP 318 migration timing
  (shorter transfer and preparation delays, and an anchor-age cap of 4 bucket
  boundaries rather than 16).
- A canonical ZIP 318 crossing is now funded from the single oldest Orchard note
  that covers the payment and its fee, falling back to ordinary multi-note funding
  when no such note exists. Canonical-denomination payments that previously lost
  the canonical shape to multi-note funding now take it whenever a single covering
  note exists.
- Migration transfer ids are `Long` (the engine's `u32`, widened as this JNI boundary widens every
  unsigned 32-bit value) rather than decimal strings, across `JniTransferProposal`,
  `JniPreparedTransfer`, `JniMigrationTransferState`, `JniUnsignedTransferPczt`,
  `JniAttentionReason.InvalidTransfer`, their `MigrationSdk` counterparts
  (`TransferProposal`, `MigrationTransferState`, `AttentionReason.InvalidTransfer`),
  `recordTransferResult(transferId:)`, and the `ids` array of `storeSignedSchedulePczts`
  (now a `LongArray`). The id identifies the TRANSFER, not one broadcast attempt: a rebuilt
  expired transfer keeps its id while getting a new transaction id, so it stays the key to
  correlate on.
- The native backend no longer runs any DDL or direct DML against wallet-database
  internals: the pre-release schema self-heal shim for
  `orchard_ironwood_migration_transactions` is removed (wallets created against
  pre-release schema shapes must be recreated), and the debug-only
  `OrchardMigrationSdk.clearMigration` now cancels the run through the engine
  store (persisting it as failed, so `getMigrationState` reports
  `RequiresAttention` rather than `NotStarted` until a new run is committed)
  instead of deleting the engine's rows with raw SQL. The Slipstream
  `getTransactionRaw` host read now queries the public `v_transactions` view
  instead of a wallet-internal base table.
- On testnet, pool-migration transfers are now bucketed onto a 12-block anchor
  grid instead of ZIP 318's 144-block one, and the transfer/preparation
  broadcast delays scale down with it, so a migration can be exercised end to
  end in minutes rather than days. Mainnet is unchanged and still uses the ZIP
  318 parameters. A testnet wallet that committed a migration before this change
  has its transfers anchored to the old grid; those runs must be restarted.

### Fixed
- The legacy `Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions` and `Synchronizer.createTransactionFromPczt`
  helpers now register transactions in `PendingSubmitPlanStore`. Before this change the legacy
  paths bypassed the plan store entirely, so a sync-loop `resubmitUnminedTransactions` tick that
  fired during the active `submit()` RPC could race the foreground submit with a second
  `txManager.submit()`. With the plan-store dance, the in-flight window is `AwaitingPlan` and the
  resubmit step skips it. Note that `resubmitUnminedTransactions` is DB-driven (loads
  unmined-and-not-expired txs from the wallet DB) and does not query the mempool, so a tx that
  has been accepted into a server's mempool but not yet mined will still be re-broadcast on the
  next sync tick — that mempool-duplication path is handled by the "verify against the server"
  reclassification (separate `## Fixed` entry below). This entry narrows the *in-flight* race
  window specifically. The public `Broadcaster.submit` and both legacy helpers record their
  endpoint after the submit RPC returns (rather than before), and the write is wrapped in
  `NonCancellable` so a coroutine cancellation mid-submit cannot leave the plan stranded at
  `AwaitingPlan`.
- `Synchronizer.submitTransaction` (and the broadcaster equivalent) now verifies submit failures
  against the server before surfacing them: when the submit RPC returns a non-zero error code
  (and not a gRPC-layer failure), the SDK immediately asks the same lightwalletd whether the tx
  is known via `fetchTransaction`, and reclassifies the result as `TransactionSubmitResult.Success`
  if the server reports the tx is in mempool or chain. This covers the cases that previously
  produced misleading failure UIs — Zebra's `MempoolError::InMempool` / `AlreadyQueued`, zcashd's
  `RPC_VERIFY_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN`, and any future "already known" variant — without depending on
  backend-specific error codes or message text.
- An account created from a checkpoint now receives the Ironwood commitment tree
  state that checkpoint carries. The SDK read only the Sapling and Orchard trees out
  of a checkpoint's tree state and dropped the Ironwood one, so such an account was
  created with no Ironwood tree state at its birthday height. The field is optional
  and no mainnet checkpoint currently ships one, so this reached test networks first.

The remainder were picked up from the librustzcash update:

- `Synchronizer.createTransactionFromPczt` now records the transaction's Ironwood
  outputs. Every Ironwood output was previously dropped when the transaction was
  stored: for a post-NU6.3 PCZT that delivers its payment through the Ironwood pool,
  the external recipient's address and decrypted memo were never persisted and are
  not recoverable afterwards, and the wallet's own Ironwood outputs stayed invisible
  until the transaction was mined and scanned.
- A wallet whose database was upgraded by a build using
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.1` (the 2.6.6 internal build) no longer fails
  every scan. Such a wallet's `orchard_ironwood_migrations` table never acquired
  the `anchor_bucket_interval` column, added to the table-creation migration in
  place afterwards, and the column reference then failed on every scan — no block
  could be written and no transaction ever acquired a mined height, whether or not
  a pool migration was in progress. A new database migration adds the missing
  column. The backfilled value is exact on the production network; on a test
  network, a pool migration planned under a custom anchor grid is reported as
  `AnchorIntervalMismatch` and must be re-planned.
- A ZIP 318 crossing anchored to a bucket boundary whose block contains no note
  commitments in any pool no longer fails with `ProposalError::AnchorNotFound`:
  scanning now creates a checkpoint at every anchor-retention grid height, and
  proposal creation additionally falls back to an ordinary crossing when no anchor
  is computable at the boundary rather than proposing a build that would fail.
- Note selection now draws the oldest eligible notes first, in note commitment
  tree (chain) order. Notes were previously drawn in scan-discovery order, which
  for a restored wallet prefers its most recently discovered — typically newest —
  notes.
- A payment to one of the wallet's own transparent addresses is now reported with
  the transparent receiver address itself as the output's recipient, rather than
  the receiving account's unified address; for outputs the wallet created, the
  recipient address recorded at transaction construction time takes precedence
  over the receiving address.

## [2.8.0-rc.3] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- Migrated to `zcash_client_backend-0.24.0-rc.6`, `zcash_client_sqlite-0.22.0-rc.6`

## [2.8.0-rc.2] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- Migrated to `zcash_client_backend-0.24.0-rc.5`, `zcash_client_sqlite-0.22.0-rc.5`

## [2.8.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- `Synchronizer.broadcaster`, a `Broadcaster` that separates transaction creation from
  submission. `createProposedTransactions` and `createTransactionFromPczt` create and store
  transactions locally and return them as `CreatedTransaction`s; `submit(transaction, endpoint)`
  sends one to a caller-chosen lightwalletd endpoint. A transaction created this way is not
  automatically resubmitted until it has been submitted at least once through `submit`, after
  which automatic retry uses the endpoints it was actually submitted to rather than the endpoint
  the synchronizer was built with. The same-named `Synchronizer` methods are unchanged: they
  still create and submit in one step, to the builder-configured endpoint.
- `CreatedTransaction` (`txId`, `raw`, `expiryHeight`), the transaction handle that `Broadcaster`
  returns and accepts.
- `Synchronizer.fullyScannedHeight`, the height up to which the wallet has trial-decrypted every
  block, and `Synchronizer.getTreeState(height)`, which returns the protobuf-encoded note
  commitment tree state at a height so consumers can generate witnesses or verify inclusion
  proofs without using the lightwalletd transport directly. `getTreeState` performs a live server
  request and does not wait for local scan state; callers combining its result with local wallet
  data at the same height should first check that `fullyScannedHeight` has reached `height`.

### Changed
- `Synchronizer` gains three abstract members — `fullyScannedHeight`, `getTreeState` and
  `getWalletDbPathForVoting` — so any implementer or test fake must now provide them.
  `broadcaster` is not abstract: it defaults to an implementation whose every method throws
  `UnsupportedOperationException`.
- New wallets now initialize from a tree state fetched from the server 100 blocks below the chain
  tip instead of from the bundled checkpoint, so a wallet with no transaction history starts near
  the tip and scans far fewer blocks while staying reorg-safe. If that fetch does not complete
  within 5 seconds, initialization falls back to the bundled checkpoint. Wallet restore is
  unaffected.
- `String.fromHex` now throws `IllegalArgumentException` on odd-length or non-hex input instead
  of silently coercing malformed strings.
- `Synchronizer.getAccounts` now rethrows `CancellationException` instead of wrapping it in
  `InitializeException.GetAccountsException`, so cancelling the calling coroutine no longer
  surfaces as an account-loading failure.
- Shielded voting is unavailable in this release, and `VotingRustBackend` — in the
  separately published `zcash-android-backend` artifact — is now deprecated at
  `ERROR` level. Referencing it is a compile error rather than a runtime
  `UnsatisfiedLinkError`, because the native library exports none of the symbols
  its methods bind to. There is no alternative code path: callers must remove
  every use for this release. Consumers who depend only on
  `zcash-android-sdk` are unaffected, as the backend artifact is not on their
  compile classpath. `Synchronizer.getWalletDbPathForVoting` still returns a
  path, but nothing in this release can act on it.
- `FiatCurrencyConversion.fiatCurrency` is now a constructor parameter rather
  than a fixed property, and can be set to a currency other than
  `FiatCurrency.USD`. It previously always held `USD` and took no part in the
  generated `data class` members; it now participates in `equals`, `hashCode`,
  `toString` and `copy`. Code comparing two conversions will now see values that
  differ only in currency as unequal, and code that destructures gains a third
  component. Two-argument construction still compiles unchanged and defaults to
  `USD`.
- Updated checkpoints for testnet.

### Fixed
- `CompactBlockProcessor` no longer crashes with an `IllegalArgumentException` from
  `PercentDecimal` when both the scan and recovery progress ranges are empty (e.g. right after
  importing an account whose birthday is at the chain tip). The combined progress ratio now uses
  the same zero-denominator semantics as the individual ratios: an empty range means 100%.

## [2.7.0-rc.4] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- Updated the librustzcash crates to `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.6` and
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.6`, adopting the revised ZIP 318 migration timing
  (shorter transfer and preparation delays, and an anchor-age cap of 4 bucket
  boundaries rather than 16).
- A canonical ZIP 318 crossing is now funded from the single oldest Orchard note
  that covers the payment and its fee, falling back to ordinary multi-note funding
  when no such note exists. Canonical-denomination payments that previously lost
  the canonical shape to multi-note funding now take it whenever a single covering
  note exists.

### Fixed
All of the following were picked up from the librustzcash update:

- A wallet whose database was upgraded by a build using
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.1` (the 2.6.6 internal build) no longer fails
  every scan. Such a wallet's `orchard_ironwood_migrations` table never acquired
  the `anchor_bucket_interval` column, added to the table-creation migration in
  place afterwards, and the column reference then failed on every scan — no block
  could be written and no transaction ever acquired a mined height, whether or not
  a pool migration was in progress. A new database migration adds the missing
  column. The backfilled value is exact on the production network; on a test
  network, a pool migration planned under a custom anchor grid is reported as
  `AnchorIntervalMismatch` and must be re-planned.
- A ZIP 318 crossing anchored to a bucket boundary whose block contains no note
  commitments in any pool no longer fails with `ProposalError::AnchorNotFound`:
  scanning now creates a checkpoint at every anchor-retention grid height, and
  proposal creation additionally falls back to an ordinary crossing when no anchor
  is computable at the boundary rather than proposing a build that would fail.
- Note selection now draws the oldest eligible notes first, in note commitment
  tree (chain) order. Notes were previously drawn in scan-discovery order, which
  for a restored wallet prefers its most recently discovered — typically newest —
  notes.
- A payment to one of the wallet's own transparent addresses is now reported with
  the transparent receiver address itself as the output's recipient, rather than
  the receiving account's unified address; for outputs the wallet created, the
  recipient address recorded at transaction construction time takes precedence
  over the receiving address.

## [2.7.0-rc.3] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- Updated the librustzcash crates to `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.5` and
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.5`.
- A payment that crosses the Orchard turnstile in a canonical ZIP 318 denomination (a
  `{1, 2, 5} * 10^k` amount between 0.01 and 10,000 ZEC), and that the wallet can fund
  from a single Orchard note, is now proposed as a canonical crossing: anchored on the
  ZIP 318 bucket grid, given the ZIP 318 rolling expiry height, and built with one
  unpadded Ironwood action instead of two. Such a transaction pays one fewer ZIP 317
  marginal-fee action, but its inputs may require up to two bucket intervals of
  additional confirmations before it can be proposed. When the wallet cannot fund the
  payment that way, an ordinary transaction is proposed as before.

### Fixed
All of the following were picked up from the librustzcash update:

- An Ironwood note received on an account's internal address is now classified as
  change once the wallet learns that the same account funded the transaction, as
  Sapling and Orchard notes already were. An Ironwood change note recorded before its
  transaction's spends could be linked to the wallet previously kept the wrong
  classification permanently: transaction history counted it as a received (and sent)
  note rather than change, presenting the account's own change as a recipient of the
  transaction. Balances were not affected. Notes recorded with the wrong
  classification are repaired by a database migration on upgrade; no rescan is
  required.
- An address that had received only Ironwood notes was treated as never having been
  used: the transparent address gap-limit search could hand the same address out
  again, and the receiving account was not reported as involved in the transaction
  that paid it. Since NU6.3 every payment to an Orchard receiver is delivered in the
  Ironwood bundle, so this affected ordinary received payments. A database migration
  corrects the affected records on upgrade.
- The funding account recorded for a transparent output now takes value spent from
  the Ironwood pool into account. An output whose creating transaction was funded
  entirely from Ironwood was attributed to no account, and one funded from several
  pools could be attributed to an account other than the largest contributor.
  Post-NU6.3 wallets hold their shielded value in Ironwood, so this affected ordinary
  spends.
- Transaction status queries issued during sync are now generated from explicit,
  durable observation intent: a sent transaction is queried by txid when the wallet
  cannot observe one of its shielded spends or outputs — including a transaction
  funded entirely by transparent inputs whose shielded outputs all belong to another
  wallet — and the intent lies dormant while the transaction is mined, becoming
  active again after a chain rewind. Redundant status queries previously synthesized
  for transactions the wallet can observe by scanning are no longer produced.
- Tor network operations — Tor-backed lightwalletd connections and the exchange-rate
  fetch behind `Synchronizer.exchangeRateUsd` — are now bounded in time. A server
  that accepted a connection and then never responded previously left the request
  pending indefinitely, and could thereby stall the exchange-rate fetch, which
  aggregates several exchanges.

## [2.7.0-rc.2] - 2026-07-26

### Changed
- Updated the librustzcash crates to `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.4` and
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.4`.
- `addProofsToPczt` now reuses a cached Orchard proving key (via `zcash_primitives`'
  `cached_orchard_proving_key`) instead of rebuilding it for every proof, so proving a PCZT with
  both Orchard and Ironwood bundles no longer constructs the key twice.

### Fixed
- Hardware-wallet signing of post-NU6.3 (v6) transactions: the wallet-controlled zero-value
  Orchard spends that pad such transactions now carry ZIP 32 derivation metadata (via
  `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.4`), so signers can identify and sign them. Previously these
  actions were unsignable and v6 sends failed at finalization with
  `Pczt(Extraction(Orchard(Extract(MissingSpendAuthSig))))` even though the device approved the
  transaction.
- `addProofsToPczt` now creates Ironwood proofs. It previously only handled Orchard and Sapling,
  so any PCZT with Ironwood Actions (e.g. a Keystone-signed spend from the Ironwood pool) failed
  at extraction with `Pczt(Extraction(Ironwood(Extract(MissingProof))))`.
- Hardware-wallet (Keystone) PCZT signing now sends the full (non-compacted) signer view in the
  minimal PCZT encoding (v1 for v5 transactions). The compact view/v2-encoding wire contract is
  not supported by deployed firmware's ordinary signing flow, and caused finalization failures
  with `MissingSpendAuthSig`.
- The PCZT signer view now redacts the Ironwood bundle as it already did Orchard and
  Sapling: each action's spend witness and the SDK's internal per-output metadata are
  removed before the PCZT is sent to the external signer. A spend from the Ironwood
  pool previously shipped its Merkle witnesses (which locate the wallet's notes in
  the global commitment tree) and wallet output metadata to the signing device, which
  needs neither.

## [2.7.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Ironwood (NU6.3) shielded pool support: the SDK now exposes the Ironwood pool
  (balance, subtree roots, sync) alongside Sapling and Orchard.
- `Synchronizer.proposeOrchardToIronwoodMigration`, which builds a proposal that
  moves the account's entire Orchard balance across the NU6.3 turnstile into the
  Ironwood pool.

  **This migration is not private.** It produces a single transaction whose value
  is the account's entire Orchard balance, so any chain observer can read that
  balance off the chain. The SDK deliberately does not split the crossing into
  less-identifying denominations. Wallets should surface this in the confirmation
  UI rather than presenting the migration as a routine self-send.
- `CompactBlockProcessorException.MismatchedConsensusBranch`, `MismatchedNetwork`
  and `MismatchedSaplingActivationHeight` now expose their constructor arguments
  as public `val`s (`clientBranchId`/`serverBranchId`,
  `clientNetwork`/`serverNetwork`, `clientHeight`/`serverHeight`). Previously the
  mismatched values were reachable only by parsing the exception's `message`, so
  consumers had to either scrape English prose or surface it verbatim. Wallets
  can now render a localized, structured explanation of why a server is
  incompatible. Note that consensus branch IDs are opaque unordered constants:
  neither the SDK nor a consumer can infer from them alone which side is stale.

### Breaking changes

Adding the Ironwood pool changes several public types. Downstream consumers will
need source changes:

- `AccountBalance` gains a required `ironwood: WalletBalance` property, in third
  position, before `unshielded`. Positional construction will not compile.
- `CompactBlockUnsafe` gains a required `ironwoodOutputsCount: UInt` constructor
  parameter, before `compactBlockBytes`.
- `TransactionPool` and `ShieldedProtocolEnum` each gain an `IRONWOOD` case, so
  exhaustive `when` expressions over them stop compiling until the new case is
  handled.
- `Synchronizer` gains an abstract `proposeOrchardToIronwoodMigration`, which any
  implementer or test fake must now provide.

The lightwallet protocol definitions are now vendored from
[zcash/lightwallet-protocol](https://github.com/zcash/lightwallet-protocol) at
v0.5.0 rather than maintained by hand, which changes the generated
`cash.z.wallet.sdk.internal.rpc` types. The SDK itself uses none of the
following, but consumers touching the generated gRPC types directly will:

- `CompactTx.hash` is renamed to `CompactTx.txid`, so `getHash()`/`setHash()`
  become `getTxid()`/`setTxid()`.
- `CompactBlock.protoVersion` is removed; field 1 is now reserved.
- The `Exclude` message is replaced by `GetMempoolTxRequest`, changing the
  `GetMempoolTx` RPC signature.

Additive in the same update: a `PoolType` enum, `BlockRange.poolTypes`, the
`CompactTxIn` and `TxOut` messages with `CompactTx.vin`/`vout`, four new
`LightdInfo` fields, and a `GetTaddressTransactions` RPC. `GetBlockNullifiers`
and `GetBlockRangeNullifiers` are now deprecated upstream in favour of
`GetBlockRange` with `poolTypes`.

### Changed
- Migrated to the `zcash_client_backend 0.24` / `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22` API
  line, adapting the backend to the send-max and builder API changes.
- Updated the librustzcash crates to their published releases,
  `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.2` and `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.2`.

### Fixed
Both of the following were picked up from the librustzcash update:

- `Synchronizer.deleteAccount` no longer fails when a wallet transaction had sent
  funds to an address belonging to the account being deleted (for example, after an
  internal transfer to one of the account's own addresses).
- Account balances now report value in immature transparent coinbase outputs as
  pending spendability rather than as spendable. Such value was previously counted as
  spendable even though it could not be selected for shielding until the output
  reached coinbase maturity.

## [2.6.6] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Support for the Ironwood (NU6.3) shielded pool: per-pool balances, output counts and
  subtree roots, and the Ironwood `ShieldedProtocol` variant.

### Changed
- Migrated to `zcash_client_backend 0.24`, `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22`, `zcash_protocol 0.10`,
  `zcash_primitives`/`zcash_proofs 0.29`, `orchard 0.15`, `pczt 0.8`, `zcash_transparent 0.9`.
- Updated checkpoints for mainnet and testnet.

### Internal
- The shielded-voting native surface (`zcash_voting`, the `chp-voting` feature and `mod voting`)
  is commented out, so no `Java_..._VotingRustBackend_*` JNI symbols are emitted.


## [2.6.5] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- Fixed `InvalidParameterName` error in `delete_account` for accounts with cross-account transactions ([librustzcash#2426](https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash/pull/2426)).

## [2.6.4] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- Fixed ignore of `CancellationException` which is important for coroutines.

### Changed
- Updated checkpoints for mainnet and testnet.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- Updated checkpoints for mainnet and testnet.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- New wallets now fetch a recent, reorg-safe tree state from the lightwalletd server,
  reducing unnecessary block scanning for wallets with no transaction history.
  Initialization falls back to the bundled checkpoint if the fetch does not complete
  within 5 seconds.
- `FiatCurrencyConversion.fiatCurrency` is now a constructor parameter (defaulting
  to `FiatCurrency.USD`) rather than a fixed USD-only property, so a conversion can
  carry a currency other than USD.

### Internal
- Unpinned `zcash_voting` in `Cargo.toml` in favor of the lockfile.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- Migrated to NU 6.2, updating the librustzcash crates to `zcash_client_backend 0.23`,
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.21`, `zcash_keys 0.14`, `zcash_primitives 0.28` and
  `zcash_protocol 0.9`.

### Fixed
- The librustzcash update incorporates the fixes for the Orchard proof soundness
  vulnerability GHSA-ww9q-8r59-xv46 and the Orchard non-canonical proof size issue
  GHSA-2x4w-pxqw-58v9.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- `CompactBlockProcessor.enhanceTransactionDetails` and the per-transaction `enhanceTransaction`
  step now emit structured diagnostic logs at each step of an enhance cycle — cycle start with
  request count, per-request type, fetch response shape (whether a tx was returned, whether it
  has a mined height), the decision taken (`setTransactionStatus` or `decryptAndStoreTransaction`),
  per-request errors with error type, and cycle completion. Logs use opaque per-request
  correlation ids (no transaction ids, addresses, or other PII) so production logs are debuggable
  for future stuck-transaction reports without exposing user-identifying data.
- `Synchronizer.broadcaster` API for creating transactions without immediate
  submission and submitting stored transactions to selected lightwalletd
  endpoints. Automatic retry uses the endpoints submitted through the
  broadcaster.
- `Synchronizer.fullyScannedHeight` and `Synchronizer.getTreeState` accessors
  for snapshot-height consumers.

### Changed
- `String.fromHex` now rejects odd-length and non-hex input instead of silently coercing malformed
  strings.

### Internal
- Added internal `VotingRustBackend` / `TypesafeVotingBackend` plumbing for future shielded voting backend work.
- Added internal shielded voting recovery and share-tracking persistence for replaying,
  retrying, and confirming delegation and vote submission workflows.
- Split the internal governance PCZT API into `buildGovernancePczt` (explicit Orchard
  FVK + raw hotkey address, for hardware wallets such as Keystone) and
  `buildGovernancePcztFromSeed` (UFVK + wallet seed + hotkey seed, preserving the
  UFVK<>walletSeed validation invariant for software wallets). `buildAndProveDelegation`
  now takes the raw hotkey address directly, and a new `deriveHotkeyRawAddress` helper
  exposes raw-address derivation to callers that do not retain the hotkey seed.
- Pinned `orchard` to `=0.13.1` with `unstable-voting-circuits` to match `zcash_voting` / `voting-circuits` requirements.
- Pinned `zcash_voting` to `=0.10.1`.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- Migrated to NU 6.2

### Fixed
- The librustzcash update incorporates the fixes for the Orchard proof soundness
  vulnerability GHSA-ww9q-8r59-xv46 and the Orchard non-canonical proof size issue
  GHSA-2x4w-pxqw-58v9.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that could cause transactions shielding more than 150 transparent
  P2PKH inputs to fail due to incorrect fee computation.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- Fixed `rewindToHeight` semantics
- Updated `zcash_client_sqlite` to 0.20.2. With this release, account import
  will trigger a re-scan from the birthday of the imported account, allowing
  imported accounts to discover their history and funds, at the cost of other
  accounts being temporarily blocked by a short resync (specifically rescanning
  the incomplete shard at the tip).

## [2.4.8] - 2025-04-02

### Added
- `Synchronizer.deleteAccount` function added to delete an account from the wallet

### Changed
- Updated dependencies

### Changed
- Checkpoints update

## [2.4.6] - 2025-03-06

### Fixed
- Checkpoints update
- Migrated to `zcash_client_sqlite 0.19.4`, `shardtree 0.6.2`. This fixes
  an error that could cause note commitment tree corruption (which required
  a rescan to remediate when encountered).

## [2.4.5] - 2025-02-24

### Changed
- Migrated to Rust 1.92.0.

## [2.4.4] - 2025-12-16

### Changed

  in 2.3.9 and earlier, to reduce power consumption.

## [2.4.2] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- `WalletCoordinator.resetSynchronizer` function added to kill current synchronizer and recreate a new one
- `Synchronizer.debugQuery` function added to request read-only database queries
- `Synchronizer.enhanceTransaction` function added to request an enhancement of specified transaction
- `TransactionId.new(String)` function added to create a new transaction ID from a string

### Changed
- `ResponseException` is now thrown instead of generic `Throwable` when `Response.Failure` occurs during networking
- `Synchronizer.getTorHttpClient` is now able to return a client if either tor or exchange rate has been enabled

## [2.4.1] - 2025-11-14

### Fixed
- `LightWalletClient.submitTransaction` now correctly handles errors if StatusRuntimeException is thrown

## [2.4.0] - 2025-11-05

### Added
- `Synchronizer.fetchUtxosByAddress` function added to query light wallet server to find any UTXOs associated with
  given transparent address
- `Synchronizer.getSingleUseTransparentAddress` function added that returns an ephemeral transparent address for
  one-time use
- `Synchronizer.checkSingleUseTransparentAddress` function added to check for most overdue ephemeral address within
  24h window to retrieve and store it's UTXOs.

### Changed
- Migrated to Rust 1.90.0.

## [2.3.9] - 2025-10-23

### Changed
- Updated to `zcash_client_sqlite-0.18.9` to fix problems in transparent UTXO
  selection for shielding, including incorrect handling of outputs received at
  ephemeral addresses and selection of dust transparent outputs for shielding.

## [2.3.8] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- A state when transaction is not found in mempool or main chain is now correctly handled

### Changed
- Updated to `zcash_client_sqlite-0.18.7` to improve consistency of spentness
  determination, reliability of transaction status request generation,
  and fix removal of already-fulfilled transaction enhancement requests.

## [2.3.7] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- Updated to `zcash_client_sqlite-0.18.4` to fix a problem with balance calculation
  related to detection of spends of outputs received by the wallet's ephemeral
  addresses.

## [2.3.6] - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- Updated librustzcash crates to released version

## [2.3.5] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- Fully transparent transactions that are added to the wallet as a consequence of mempool scanning are subsequently
checked to determine when they are mined into a block.

## [2.3.4] - 2025-09-29

### Added
- `RustBackend.decryptAndStoreTransaction` now returns transaction ID
- Mempool is now being observed in order to store the transactions locally

### Fixed
- Filtering transactions by memo now returns more than one item

## [2.3.3] - 2025-09-15

### Fixed
- Transactions received on a transparent address should now appear in history views when they are detected before any
  compact blocks have been scanned.
- Column expired_unmined in v_transactions is now propagated to transaction state as expired if non-null and true

## [2.3.2] - 2025-08-22

### Added
- `Synchronizer.getTorHttpClient` function added which now returns Ktors' `HttpClient` which does http requests over
  Tor Network

## [2.3.1] - 2025-08-05

### Changed
- Exchange rate calculation is now decoupled from Tor flag
- [WalletCoordinator] now takes [isExchangeRateEnabled] as a constructor parameter
  - When set to `true`, exchange rate fetching will be enabled
  - When set to `false` or `null`, exchange rate fetching will be disabled

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-28

### Added
- [WalletCoordinator] now takes [isTorEnabled] as a constructor parameter.
  - When set to `true`, lightwalletd RPC queries will be made over Tor (where possible and beneficial).
  - When set to `false` or `null`, lightwalletd RPC queries will always be made directly to the server.
- [Synchronizer] now exposes [initializationError] property containing synchronizer errors that happened during
  synchronizer init

### Fixed
- Tor client is now optional in case it's instantiation fails to prevent SDK

## [2.2.15] - 2025-06-26

### Fixed
- Tor client is now optional in case it's instantiation fails to prevent SDK from crashing

## [2.2.14] - 2025-06-16

## Fixed
- FFI 0.17.0 introduces retry logic for Tor, significantly improving the reliability of currency conversion fetches.

### Changed
- Added a `ServiceOption` parameter for functions `WalletClient.getServerInfo`, `WalletClient.getLatestBlockHeight`,
  `WalletClient.fetchTransaction`, `WalletClient.submitTransaction` and `WalletClient.getTreeState` to add the
  option to execute over Tor. Custom lightwalletd servers over VPNs like Tailscape might stop working when using Tor.
- `Synchronizer.getFastestServers` function signature changed and does not require `Context` parameter anymore

## [2.2.13] - 2025-05-16

### Added
- `Synchronizer.getCustomUnifiedAddress` allows the caller to obtain a newly-generated
  unified address with user-specified `UnifiedAddressRequest` of type `P2PKH`, `Sapling` and `Orchard` supporting
  the ability to combine these using an infix `and` function.

## [2.2.12] - 2025-04-28

### Added
- `Synchronizer.areFundsSpendable` that indicates whether are the shielded wallet balances spendable or not during
  the block synchronization process.
- `SdkSynchronizer.estimateBirthdayHeight(date: Date)` has been added to get an estimated height for a given date,
  typically used for estimating birthday.

### Changed
- The base sapling params download URL has been changed to `https://download.z.cash/downloads/`
- Checkpoints update

### Fixed
- As part of the sapling params download URL change, the extra `/` character has been removed from the result path

## [2.2.11] - 2025-04-04

### Fixed
- Database migration bugs in `zcash_client_sqlite 0.16.0` and `0.16.1` have
  been fixed by updating to `zcash_client_sqlite 0.16.2`. These caused a few
  wallets to stop working after the 2.2.9 upgrade due to failed database
  migrations.

## [2.2.9] - 2025-03-25

  `PendingTransaction` model classes
- `TransactionOverview.totalSpent` and `TransactionOverview.totalReceived` properties added to provide more
  information about shielding transaction

### Changed
- Migrated to Rust 1.84.1.
- `Synchronizer.getTransactions(accountUuid)` and `Synchronizer.transactions` now internally fill in
  `TransactionOverview.blockTimeEpochSeconds` based on the related block time
- `Synchronizer.transactions` has been renamed to `Synchronizer.allTransactions` to emphasize the fact the API
  returns transactions for all the wallet accounts
- `Synchronizer.getRecipients` now returns both address and an account existing in database

## [2.2.7] - 2024-12-18

### Added
- `Synchronizer.importAccountByUfvk()` has been added
- `Synchronizer.getAccounts()` returning all the created or imported accounts. See the documentation in `Account`.
- `Synchronizer.walletBalances: StateFlow<Map<AccountUuid, AccountBalance>?>` that is replacement for the removed

- `getTransactions(accountUuid: AccountUuid)` to get transactions belonging to the given account
- `Synchronizer.createPcztFromProposal`
- `Synchronizer.addProofsToPczt`
- `Synchronizer.createTransactionFromPczt`
- `Zip32AccountIndex`, `AccountUuid`, `AccountUsk`, `AccountPurpose`, `AccountCreateSetup`, `AcountImportSetup`, and
  `Pczt` model classes have been added to support the new or the changed APIs

### Changed
- `Account` data class works with `accountUuid: AccountUuid` instead of the previous ZIP 32 account index
- These functions from `DerivationTool` have been refactored to work with the new `Zip32AccountIndex` instead of the
  `Account` data class: `deriveUnifiedSpendingKey`, `deriveUnifiedAddress`, `deriveArbitraryAccountKey`
- `WalletCoordinator` now provides a way to instantiate `Synchronizer` with the new `accountName` and `keySource`
  parameters
- `UnifiedSpendingKey` does not hold `Account` information anymore, it has been replaced by `AccountUsk` model class
  in a few internal cases
- `Synchronizer.send` extension function receives `Account` on input
- `PendingTransaction` sealed class descendants have been renamed
- `RustLayerException.GetCurrentAddressException` has been renamed to `RustLayerException.GetAddressException`
- Checkpoints update

### Removed
- `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` have been removed, use
  `Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions` and `Synchronizer.proposeShielding` instead
- `Synchronizer.orchardBalances`, `Synchronizer.saplingBalances`, and `Synchronizer.transparentBalance`
  (use `Synchronizer.walletBalances` instead).

### Fixed
- The `CompactBlockProcessor` now correctly distinguishes between `Response.Failure.Server.Unavailable` and other
  errors in its `refreshUtxos` API. It then sets its state to `State.Disconnected` in such a case.

## [2.2.6] - 2024-11-16

### Added
- `DerivationTool.deriveArbitraryWalletKey`
- `DerivationTool.deriveArbitraryAccountKey`

- `LightWalletClient` now implements `Closeable` and is thus correctly cleaned up in `SdkSynchronizer` and
  `FastestServerFetcher` after it's used
- Checkpoints update

### Fixed
- `FailedSynchronizationException` reported using `Synchronizer.onProcessorErrorHandler` now contains the full
  stacktrace history

### Removed
- `Synchronizer.getNearestRewindHeight` (its function is now handled internally
  by `Synchronizer.rewindToNearestHeight`).
- `Synchronizer.quickRewind` and `CompactBlockProcessor.quickRewind` have been removed as they triggered the block
  rewind action at an invalid height. Use `Synchronizer.rewindToNearestHeight` instead.

## [2.2.4] - 2024-09-16

### Added
- `TransactionOverview.isShielding` has been added to indicate the shielding transaction type

### Changed
- NDK version has been updated to `27.0.12077973`
- Android `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` has been updated to 35
- `CompackBlockProcessor.calculatePollInterval` now uses a randomized poll interval to avoid exposing computation time

### Fixed
- Android 15 (SDK level 35) support added for 16 KB memory page size
- The broken disposing logic `TorClient.freeTorRuntime` for Android SDK API level 27 has been fixed

## [2.2.3] - 2024-09-09

### Changed
- Several functions have been updated to accept `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.model.Locale` instead of
  `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.model.MonetarySeparators` as an argument. MonetarySeparators are derived from Locale now.
- `FiatCurrencyConversion.toZatoshi`
- `Zatoshi.toFiatCurrencyState`
- `Zatoshi.toFiatString`
- `BigDecimal.convertFiatDecimalToFiatString`
- `Zatoshi.Companion.fromZecString`

### Added
- `Double?.convertUsdToZec` has been added as we are moving away from `BigDecimal` in favor of primitive types
- `Locale.getDefault()` has been added
- Transaction resubmission feature has been added to the CompactBlockProcessor's regular actions. This new action
  periodically checks unmined sent transactions that are still within their expiry window and resubmits them if
  there are any.

### Fixed
- Fastest Server calculation changed for estimated height

## [2.2.2] - 2024-09-03

### Fixed
- Migrated to `zcash_client_sqlite 0.11.2` to remove use of a database feature
  that prevented use of Zashi on older devices.

### Changed
- Checkpoints update

## [2.2.1] - 2024-08-22

### Fixed
- A database migration misconfiguration that could result in problems with wallet
  initialization was fixed.

## [2.2.0] - 2024-08-22

This release adds several important new features:
- Currency exchange rates (currently just USD/ZEC) are now made available via the SDK.
  The exchange rate computed as the median of values provided by at least three separate
  cryptocurrency exchanges, and is fetched over Tor connections in order to avoid leaking
  the wallet's IP address to the exchanges.
- Sending to ZIP 320 (TEX) addresses is now supported. When sending to a ZIP 320 address,
  the wallet will first automatically de-shield the required funds to a fresh ephemeral
  transparent address, and then will make a second fully-transparent transaction sending
  the funds to the eventual recipient that is not linkable via on-chain information to any
  other transaction in the  user's wallet.
- As part of adding ZIP 320 support, the SDK now also provides full support for recovering
  transparent transaction history. Prior to this release, only transactions belonging to the
  wallet that contained either some shielded component OR a member of the current
  transparent UTXO set were included in transaction history.

### Changed
- Migrated to Rust 1.80.0.
- `Synchronizer.proposeTransfer` now supports TEX addresses (ZIP 320).
- Internal transactions-enhancing logic has changed to support the history of transactions made to TEX addresses

### Added
- `Synchronizer.isValidTexAddr` which checks whether the given address is a valid ZIP 320 TEX address
- `Synchronizer.exchangeRateUsd` is a `StateFlow` containing the latest USD/ZEC
  exchange rate, along with the `Instant` it was fetched. It can be initialized
  and refreshed by calling `Synchronizer.refreshExchangeRateUsd()`.
- `ZatoshiExt.toFiatString` is now a public function
- `Synchronizer.getFastestServers([LightWalletEndpoint])` is a flow that measures connections to given endpoints and
  returns the three fastest ones
- `Synchronizer.getTAddressTransactions` returns all the transactions for a given t-address over the given range

### Changed
- Checkpoints update

## [2.1.3] - 2024-08-08

### Changed
- The fetch UTXOs action is now hooked up at the beginning of every scanning phase of the block synchronization logic
  instead of being called every 1000 blocks together with shielded transactions enhancing. It uses
  `fullyScannedHeight` as its lower bound.
- The fetch UTXOs action reports `FetchUtxosException` to the wrapping `onProcessorErrorHandler` or
  `onCriticalErrorHandler` in case any error occurs
- The internal `CompactBlockProcessor.SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` has changed. Block synchronization logic now works above
  batch of blocks with size 1000 blocks instead of just 100 blocks, except the Zcash sandblasting period in which
  batch size of 100 blocks is still used.
- The internal `FileCompactBlockRepository.BLOCKS_METADATA_BUFFER_SIZE` constant has been raised from 10 to 1000 to
  match the block synchronization batch size.
- The overall speed-up of the entire block synchronization logic, thanks to the both mentioned synchronization
  improvements above is about 50% out of the Zcash sandblasting period. There is still some improvement in the
  sandblasting period.
- Checkpoints update

### Fixed
- `Synchronizer.refreshUtxos(account: Account, since: BlockHeight)` now correctly uses the `since` parameter in the
  underlying logic and fetches UTXOs from that height

## [2.1.2] - 2024-07-16

### Added
- `SdkSynchronizer.closeFlow()` is a Flow-providing version of `Synchronizer.close()`. It safely closes the
  Synchronizer together with the related components.
- `WalletCoordinator.deleteSdkDataFlow` is a Flow-providing function that deletes all the persisted data in the SDK
  (databases associated with the wallet, all compact blocks, and data derived from those blocks) but preserves the
  wallet secrets.

### Changed
- The Android SDK target API level has been updated to version 34
- `ZecString` and `Zatoshi` APIs now handle `MonetarySeparators` with the same grouping and decimal characters
- Checkpoints update

### Fixed
- `MonetarySeparators` API does not signal an unsupported state to clients if used on a device with Locale with the
 same decimal and grouping separators. Instead, it will just omit the grouping separator.

## [2.1.1] - 2024-04-23

### Changed
- The SDK components no longer contain logging statements in the release build
- `safelyConvertToBigDecimal()` API from `CurrencyFormatter.kt` now expects decimal separator Char on input
- Gradle 8.7
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.3.0
- Kotlin 1.9.23
- Other dependencies update
- Checkpoints update

## [2.1.0] - 2024-04-09

### Added
- The Orchard support has been finished, and the SDK now fully supports sending and receiving funds on the Orchard
  addresses

### Fixed
- SDK release 1.11.0-beta01 documented that `Synchronizer.new` would throw an
  exception indicating that an internal migration requires the wallet seed, if
  called with `null`. This has been unintentionally broken the entire time: the
  handling logic for this case was accidentally removed shortly after it was
  added. The SDK now correctly throws `InitializeException.SeedRequired`.

### Changed
- `Synchronizer.refreshAllBalances` now refreshes the Orchard balances as well
- The SDK uses ZIP-317 fee system internally
- `ZcashSdk.MINERS_FEE` has been deprecated, and will be removed in 2.1.x
- `ZecSend` data class now provides `Proposal?` object initiated using `Synchronizer.proposeTransfer`
- Wallet initialization using `Synchronizer.new` now could throw a new `SeedNotRelevant` exception when the provided
  seed is not relevant to any of the derived accounts in the wallet database
- Checkpoints update

## [2.0.7] - 2024-03-08

### Fixed
- `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` now throw an
  exception if the created transaction successfully reaches `lightwalletd` but
  fails to reach its backing full node's mempool.

### Changed
- `WalletBalance` now contains new fields `changePending` and `valuePending`. Fields `total` and `pending` are
  still provided. See more in the class documentation
  `sdk-lib/src/main/java/cash/z/ecc/android/sdk/model/WalletBalance.kt`
- `Synchronizer.transparentBalances: WalletBalance` to `Synchronizer.transparentBalance: Zatoshi`
- `WalletSnapshot.transparentBalance: WalletBalance` to `WalletSnapshot.transparentBalance: Zatoshi`
- `Memo.MAX_MEMO_LENGTH_BYTES` is now available in public API
- `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` have been
  deprecated, and will be removed in 2.1.x (which will create multiple
  transactions at once for some recipients).

### Added
- APIs that enable constructing a proposal for transferring or shielding funds,
  and then creating transactions from a proposal. The intermediate proposal can
  be used to determine the required fee, before committing to producing
  transactions.
  - `Synchronizer.proposeTransfer`
  - `Synchronizer.proposeShielding`
  - `Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions`
- `WalletBalanceFixture` class with mock values that are supposed to be used only for testing purposes
- `Memo.countLength(memoString: String)` to count memo length in bytes
- `PersistableWallet.toSafeString` is a safe alternative for the regular [toString] function that prints only
  non-sensitive parts
- `Synchronizer.validateServerEndpoint` this function checks whether the provided server endpoint is valid.
  The validation is based on comparing:
  * network type
  * sapling activation height
  * consensus branch id

## [2.0.6] - 2024-01-30

### Fixed
- In 2.0.5, `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` always returned an error due to a crash
  on the Rust side. This release fixes the underlying bug.

## [2.0.5] - 2024-01-30

### Added
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.model.Proposal` (currently unused in the public API).
- System tracing to `CompactBlockProcessor` and the Rust backend.

### Changed
- Migrated to NDK 26.1.10909125 and Rust 1.75.0.
- The wallet balances are now updated immediately upon synchronizer start.
- Existing wallets will now only fetch the most recent subtree roots, improving
  synchronizer startup times.
- Performance of block scanning and `SdkSynchronizer.refreshAllBalances` has
  been improved.
- `WalletAddressFixture` fixture properties have been updated

### Fixed
- The transparent wallet balance `StateFlow` now shows the total transparent
  balance in the wallet, instead of the balance of the default address. It also
  now treats all zero-conf balance as available.

### Removed
- `SdkSynchronizer.refreshSaplingBalance` and
  `SdkSynchronizer.refreshTransparentBalance`
  (use `SdkSynchronizer.refreshAllBalances` instead).

## [2.0.4] - 2024-01-08

### Added
- `TransactionOverview.txIdString()` to provide a readable transaction ID to SDK-consuming apps
- `MonetarySeparators.current(locale: Locale? = null)` now accepts `Locale` on input to force separators locale. If
  no value is provided, the default one is used.

### Removed
- `LightWalletEndpointExt` and its functions and variables were removed from the SDK's public APIs entirely. It's
  preserved only for testing and wallet Demo app purposes. The calling wallet app should provide its own
  `LightWalletEndpoint` instance within `PersistableWallet` or `SdkSynchronizer` APIs.

### Changed
- Gradle 8.5
- Kotlin 1.9.21
- Other dependency update
- Checkpoints update

### Removed
- Several internally unused exceptions from `Exceptions.kt`

## [2.0.3] - 2023-11-08

### Added
- `Synchronizer.getExistingDataDbFilePath` public API to check and provide file path to the existing data database
  file or throws [InitializeException.MissingDatabaseException] if the database doesn't exist yet. See #1292.

### Changed
- `CompactBlockProcessor` switched internally from balance and progress FFIs to wallet summary FFI APIs. This change
  brings a block synchronization speed up. No action is required on the client side. See #1282.
- Checkpoints update

## [2.0.2] - 2023-10-20

### Fixed
- Incorrect note deduplication in the `v_transactions` database view: This is a fix in the Rust layer. The amount
  sent in the transaction was incorrectly reported even though the actual amount was correctly sent. Now, clients
  should see the amount they expect to see.

### Changed
- Checkpoints update

## [2.0.1] - 2023-10-02

### Changed
- `PersistableWallet` API provides a new `endpoint` parameter of type `LightWalletEndpoint`, which could be used for
  the Lightwalletd server customization. The new parameter is part of PersistableWallet persistence. The SDK handles
  the persistence migration internally.
- The **1_000** Zatoshi fee proposed in ZIP-313 is deprecated now, so the minimum is **10_000** Zatoshi, defined in
  ZIP-317—the `ZcashSdk.MINERS_FEE` now returns the correct value as described above. Note that the actual fee is
  handled in a rust layer.
- Adopted the latest Bip39 library v1.0.6

## [2.0.0] - 2023-09-25

## [2.0.0-rc.4] - 2023-09-22

### Fixed
Transparent balance is now correctly updated after a shielding transaction is
created, instead of only once the transaction is mined.

## [2.0.0-rc.3] - 2023-09-21

### Fixed
The Kotlin layer of the SDK now correctly matches the Rust layer `PrevHashMismatch` exception with `ContinuityError`
and triggers rewind action.

## [2.0.0-rc.2] - 2023-09-20

### Changed
- Some of the `TransactionOverview` class parameters changed:
  - `id` was removed
  - `index` is nullable
  - `feePaid` is nullable
  - `blockTimeEpochSeconds` is nullable

### Removed
- Block heights are absolute, not relative. Thus, these two operations above the `BlockHeight` object were removed:
  - `plus(other: BlockHeight): BlockHeight`
  - `minus(other: BlockHeight): BlockHeight`

## [2.0.0-rc.1] - 2023-09-12

### Notable Changes

- `CompactBlockProcessor` now processes compact blocks from the lightwalletd
  server using the **Spend-before-Sync** algorithm, which allows scanning of
  wallet blocks to be performed in arbitrary order and optimized to make it
  possible to spend received notes without waiting for synchronization to be
  complete. This feature shortens the time until a wallet's spendable balance
  can be used.
- The block synchronization mechanism is additionally about one-third faster
  thanks to an optimized `CompactBlockProcessor.SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` (issue **#1206**).

### Removed
- `CompactBlockProcessor.ProcessorInfo.lastSyncHeight` no longer had a
  well-defined meaning after implementation of the **SpendBeforeSync**
  synchronization algorithm and has been removed.
  `CompactBlockProcessor.ProcessorInfo.overallSyncRange` provides related
  information.
- `CompactBlockProcessor.ProcessorInfo.isSyncing`. Use `Synchronizer.status` instead.
- `CompactBlockProcessor.ProcessorInfo.syncProgress`. Use `Synchronizer.progress` instead.
- `alsoClearBlockCache` parameter from rewind functions of `Synchronizer` and
  `CompactBlockProcessor`, as it has no effect on the current behaviour of
  these functions.
- Internally, we removed access to the shared block table from the Kotlin
  layer, which resulted in eliminating these APIs:
  - `SdkSynchronizer.findBlockHash()`
  - `SdkSynchronizer.findBlockHashAsHex()`

### Changed
- `CompactBlockProcessor.quickRewind()` and `CompactBlockProcessor.rewindToNearestHeight()`
  now might fail due to internal changes in getting scanned height. Thus, these
  functions now return `Boolean` results.
- `Synchronizer.new()` and `PersistableWallet` APIs require a new
  `walletInitMode` parameter of type `WalletInitMode`, which describes wallet
  initialization mode. See related function and sealed class documentation.

### Fixed
- `Synchronizer.getMemos()` now correctly returns a flow of strings for sent
  and received transactions. Issue **#1154**.
- `CompactBlockProcessor` now triggers transaction polling while block
  synchronization is in progress as expected. Clients will be notified shortly
  after every new transaction is discovered via `Synchronizer.transactions`
  API. Issue **#1170**.

## [1.21.0-beta01]

Note: This is the last _1.x_ version release. The upcoming version _2.0_ brings the **Spend-before-Sync** feature,
which speeds up discovering the wallet's spendable balance.

### Changed
- Updated dependencies:
   - Gradle 8.3
   - AGP 8.1.1
   - Kotlin 1.9.10
   - Coroutines 1.7.3
   - Compose
   - AndroidX
   - gRPC/Protobuf
   - etc.
- Checkpoints

## 1.20.0-beta01
- The SDK internally migrated from `BackendExt` rust backend extension functions to more type-safe `TypesafeBackend`.
- `Synchronizer.getMemos()` now internally handles expected `RuntimeException` from the rust layer and transforms it
  in an empty string.

## 1.19.0-beta01
### Changed
- Adopted the latest Bip39 version 1.0.5

### Fixed
- `TransactionOverview` object returned with `SdkSynchronizer.transactions` now contains a correct `TransactionState.
  Pending` in case of the transaction is mined,but not fully confirmed.
- When the SDK internally works with a recently created transaction there was a moment in which could the transaction
  causes the SDK to crash, because of its invalid mined height. Fixed now.

## 1.18.0-beta01
- Synchronizer's functions `getUnifiedAddress`, `getSaplingAddress`, `getTransparentAddress`, and `refreshUtxos` now
  do not provide `Account.DEFAULT` value for the account argument. As accounts are not fully supported by the SDK
  yet, the caller should explicitly set Account.DEFAULT as the account argument to keep the same behavior.
- Gradle 8.1.1
- AGP 8.0.2

## 1.17.0-beta01
- Transparent fund balances are now displayed almost immediately
- Synchronization of shielded balances and transaction history is about 30% faster
- Disk space usage is reduced by about 90%
- `Synchronizer.status` has been simplified by combining `DOWNLOADING`, `VALIDATING`, and `SCANNING` states into a single `SYNCING` state.
- `Synchronizer.progress` now returns `Flow<PercentDecimal>` instead of `Flow<Int>`. PercentDecimal is a type-safe model. Use `PercentDecimal.toPercentage()` to get a number within 0-100% scale.
- `Synchronizer.clearedTransactions` has been renamed to `Synchronizer.transactions` and includes sent, received, and pending transactions.  Synchronizer APIs for listing sent, received, and pending transactions have been removed.  Clients can determine whether a transaction is sent, received, or pending by filtering the `TransactionOverview` objects returned by `Synchronizer.transactions`
- `Synchronizer.send()` and `shieldFunds()` are now `suspend` functions with `Long` return values representing the ID of the newly created transaction.  Errors are reported by thrown exceptions.
 - `DerivationTool` is now an interface, rather than an `object`, which makes it easier to inject alternative implementations into tests.  To adapt to the new API, replace calls to `DerivationTool.methodName()` with `DerivationTool.getInstance().methodName()`.
 - `DerivationTool` methods are no longer suspending, which should make it easier to call them in various situations.  Obtaining a `DerivationTool` instance via `DerivationTool.getInstance()` frontloads the need for a suspending call.
 - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKeys()` no longer has a default argument for `numberOfAccounts`.  Clients should now pass `DerivationTool.DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_ACCOUNTS` as the value. Note that the SDK does not currently have proper support for multiple accounts.
 - The SDK's internals for connecting with librustzcash have been refactored to a separate Gradle module `backend-lib` (and therefore a separate artifact) which is a transitive dependency of the Zcash Android SDK.  SDK consumers that use Gradle dependency locks may notice this difference, but otherwise it should be mostly an invisible change.

## 1.16.0-beta01
(This version was only deployed as a snapshot and not released on Maven Central)
### Changed
 - The minimum supported version of Android is now API level 27.

## 1.15.0-beta01
### Changed
- A new package `sdk-incubator-lib` is now available as a public API.  This package contains experimental APIs that may be promoted to the SDK in the future.  The APIs in this package are not guaranteed to be stable, and may change at any time.
- `Synchronizer.refreshUtxos` now takes `Account` type as first parameter instead of transparent address of type
    `String`, and thus it downloads all UTXOs for the given account addresses. The Account object provides a default `0` index Account with `Account.DEFAULT`.

## 1.14.0-beta01
### Changed
 - The minimum supported version of Android is now API level 24.

## 1.13.0-beta01
### Changed
- The SDK's internal networking has been refactored to a separate Gradle module `lightwallet-client-lib` (and
  therefore a separate artifact) which is a transitive dependency of the Zcash Android SDK.
    - The `z.cash.ecc.android.sdk.model.LightWalletEndpoint` class has been moved to `co.electriccoin.lightwallet.client.model.LightWalletEndpoint`
    - The new networking module now provides a `LightWalletClient` for asynchronous calls.
    - Most unary calls respond with the new `Response` class and its subclasses. Streaming calls will be updated
      with the Response class later.
    - SDK clients should avoid using generated GRPC objects, as these are an internal implementation detail and are in process of being removed from the public API.  Any clients using GRPC objects will find these have been repackaged from `cash.z.wallet.sdk.rpc` to `cash.z.wallet.sdk.internal.rpc` to signal they are not a public API.

## 1.12.0-beta01
### Changed
 - `TransactionOverview`, `Transaction.Sent`, and `Transaction.Received` have `minedHeight` as a nullable field now.  This fixes a potential crash when fetching transactions when a transaction is in the mempool

## 1.11.0-beta01
### Added
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk`:
  - `Synchronizer.getUnifiedAddress`
  - `Synchronizer.getSaplingAddress`
  - `Synchronizer.isValidUnifiedAddr`
  - `Synchronizer.getMemos(TransactionOverview)`
  - `Synchronizer.getReceipients(TransactionOverview)`
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.model`:
  - `Account`
  - `FirstClassByteArray`
  - `PendingTransaction`
  - `Transaction`
  - `UnifiedSpendingKey`
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.tool`:
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedSpendingKey`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAccountPrivateKey`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAddressFromAccountPrivateKey`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedAddress`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKeys`
  - `DerivationTool.validateUnifiedFullViewingKey`
    - Still unimplemented.
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.type`:
  - `AddressType.Unified`
  - `UnifiedFullViewingKey`, representing a Unified Full Viewing Key as specified in
    [ZIP 316](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0316#encoding-of-unified-full-incoming-viewing-keys).

### Changed
- The following methods now take or return `UnifiedFullViewingKey` instead of
  `UnifiedViewingKey`:
    - `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk`:
      - `Initializer.Config.addViewingKey`
      - `Initializer.Config.importWallet`
      - `Initializer.Config.newWallet`
      - `Initializer.Config.setViewingKeys`
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk`:
  - `Synchronizer.Companion.new` now takes many of the arguments previously passed to `Initializer`. In addition, an optional `seed` argument is required for first-time initialization or if `Synchronizer.new` throws an exception indicating that an internal migration requires the wallet seed.  (This second case will be true the first time existing clients upgrade to this new version of the SDK).
  - `Synchronizer.new()` now returns an instance that implements the `Closeable` interface.  `Synchronizer.stop()` is effectively renamed to `Synchronizer.close()`
  - `Synchronizer` ensures that multiple instances cannot be running concurrently with the same network and alias
  - `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` now takes a `UnifiedSpendingKey` instead of an encoded
    Sapling extended spending key, and the `fromAccountIndex` argument is now implicit in
    the `UnifiedSpendingKey`.
  - `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` now takes a `UnifiedSpendingKey` instead of separately
    encoded Sapling and transparent keys.
  - `Synchronizer` methods that previously took an `Int` for account index now take an `Account` object
  - `Synchronizer.sendToAddress()` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds()` return flows that can now be collected multiple times.  Prior versions of the SDK had a bug that could submit transactions multiple times if the flow was collected more than once.
- Updated dependencies:
  - Kotlin 1.7.21
  - AndroidX
  - etc.
- Updated checkpoints

### Removed
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk`:
  - `Initializer` (use `Synchronizer.new` instead)
  - `Synchronizer.start()` - Synchronizer is now started automatically when constructing a new instance.
  - `Synchronizer.getAddress` (use `Synchronizer.getUnifiedAddress` instead).
  - `Synchronizer.getShieldedAddress` (use `Synchronizer.getSaplingAddress` instead)
  - `Synchronizer.cancel`
  - `Synchronizer.cancelSpend`
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.type.UnifiedViewingKey`
  - This type had a bug where the `extpub` field actually was storing a plain transparent
    public key, and not the extended public key as intended. This made it incompatible
    with ZIP 316.
- `cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.tool`:
  - `DerivationTool.deriveSpendingKeys` (use `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedSpendingKey` instead)
  - `DerivationTool.deriveViewingKey` (use `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey` instead)
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAddress` (use `Synchronizer.getLegacyTransparentAddress` instead).
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAddressFromPrivateKey` (use `Synchronizer.getLegacyTransparentAddress` instead).
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentAddressFromPublicKey` (use `Synchronizer.getLegacyTransparentAddress` instead).
  - `DerivationTool.deriveTransparentSecretKey` (use `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedSpendingKey` instead).
  - `DerivationTool.deriveShieldedAddress`
  - `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedViewingKeys` (use `DerivationTool.deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey` instead)
  - `DerivationTool.validateUnifiedViewingKey`

## Version 1.9.0-beta05
- The minimum version of Android supported is now API 21
- Fixed R8/ProGuard consumer rule, which eliminates a runtime crash for minified apps

## Version 1.9.0-beta04
- The SDK now stores sapling param files in `no_backup/co.electricoin.zcash` folder instead of the `cache/params`
  folder. Besides that, `SaplingParamTool` also does validation of downloaded sapling param file hash and size.
**No action required from client app**.

## Version 1.9.0-beta03
- No changes; this release is a test of a new deployment process

## Version 1.9.0-beta02
- The SDK now stores database files in `no_backup/co.electricoin.zcash` folder instead of the `database` folder. **No action required from client app**.

## Version 1.9.0-beta01
 - Split `ZcashNetwork` into `ZcashNetwork` and `LightWalletEndpoint` to decouple network and server configuration
 - Gradle 7.5.1
 - Updated checkpoints

## Version 1.8.0-beta01
- Enabled automated unit tests run on the CI server
- Added `BlockHeight` typesafe object to represent block heights
- Significantly reduced memory usage, fixing potential OutOfMemoryError during block download

## Version 1.5.0-beta01
- New: Transactions can be created after NU5 activation.
- New: Support for receiving v5 transactions.
- Known issues: The SDK will not run on Intel 64-bit API 31+ emulators.  Workarounds include: testing on a physical device, using an older 32-bit API version Intel emulator, or using an ARM emulator.

## Version 1.4.0-beta01
- Main entrypoint to the SDK has changed.  See [MIGRATIONS.md](MIGRATIONS.md)
- The minimum version of Android supported is now API 19
- Updated checkpoints for Mainnet and Testnet
- Internal bugfixes around concurrent access to resources, which could cause transient failures and data corruption
