/*
 * Kotlin interface for the Orchard → Ironwood migration SDK bridge.
 *
 * Boundary: SDK owns all business logic (split algorithm, anchor height selection,
 * transaction signing, storage, invalidity detection). App owns UI, WorkManager
 * scheduling, permissions, and notifications.
 *
 * Based on: Orchard Migration Flow — Implementation Proposal (Path A)
 * Sync: 2026-06-17
 *
 * Reconciled 2026-07-10 against the real Rust bridge (`zcash_pool_migration` crate,
 * `zcash/librustzcash` branch `michal/ironwood-migration`, PR #2572) — see the "Implementation
 * note (Rust bridge, ...)" comments below for what changed and why:
 * - [proposeMigrationTransfers] / [restartCurrentMigrationStep] gained an `includeResidual`
 *   parameter (pass `false` until the opt-in UI exists).
 * - [reconcileInvalidations] is the replacement for the old non-persisting rescheduleOverdueTransfer
 *   stub that had a units bug — backed by a real Rust call. (The `rescheduleUnprovenTransfer` shift
 *   API that once lived alongside it was deleted 2026-07-28: rescheduling is the ENGINE's semantics
 *   — unexpired transfers prove late and broadcast late; this layer never mutates the plan.)
 * - `initializePostUpgrade()` was removed — unused anywhere in the app, and `MigrationContext`
 *   has no corresponding "post-upgrade init" step (everything is computed live from wallet state).
 * - [submitNoteSplit] / [executeNextPendingTransfer] are each a composition of several Rust calls
 *   (sign/fetch → extract → broadcast via the existing submission path → record result) — the
 *   Kotlin signatures are unchanged, but see their doc comments for the real implementation shape.
 * - [isSyncBlocked] / [privacySyncBufferDuration] are confirmed Kotlin-only (no Rust backing) —
 *   the sync/broadcast de-correlation technique they implement lives entirely in this SDK layer.
 *
 * Reconciled 2026-07-18 while wiring the external-signer (Keystone hardware wallet) path:
 * - New: [createUnsignedNoteSplitPczt] / [storeSignedNoteSplitPczt] and
 *   [createUnsignedTransferPczts] / [storeSignedSchedulePczts] split [submitNoteSplit]'s and
 *   [signAndStoreMigrationSchedule]'s "sign" step into "build the unsigned PCZT" / "accept an
 *   externally-produced signature" halves, for callers with no software spending key at all.
 *   [createUnsignedTransferPczts]'s self-funding transfers use the same sign-now/prove-later
 *   placeholder-witness scheme [signAndStoreMigrationSchedule] does — [finalizeReadyTransfers]
 *   completes them the same way regardless of which path signed them.
 * - New: [buildKeystoneSignBatchQrParts] / [resetKeystoneSignBatchDecoder] /
 *   [decodeKeystoneSignBatchPart] / [applyKeystoneBatchSignatures] — the Keystone-specific
 *   animated-QR batch-signing bridge (encode every unsigned PCZT the caller wants signed as one
 *   multi-part UR QR sequence; decode the device's scanned response back into per-PCZT
 *   signatures). Pure PCZT/UR operations with no wallet-database access, unlike almost everything
 *   else in this interface.
 *
 * Reconciled 2026-07-15 while wiring the real JNI implementation:
 * - [submitNoteSplit] / [signAndStoreMigrationSchedule] gained a `usk: UnifiedSpendingKey`
 *   parameter — sdk-lib never stores/derives a spending key itself (see
 *   [Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions]), and the Rust calls they wrap require one.
 * - [getMigrationState] / [getMigrationProgress] / [isNoteSplitNeeded] / [hasOverdueTransfers] /
 *   [hasInvalidTransfers] are `suspend` — each opens a `MigrationContext` against the wallet's
 *   SQLite database, unlike the mock's free in-memory answers.
 *
 * Reconciled 2026-07-23 removing a dead gate: `isSyncRequiredBeforeNextTransfer()` — a real Rust
 * JNI call that always returned `false` — was deleted entirely. It was never a working check to
 * begin with; [isSyncBlocked]'s `next_broadcastable`-driven overdue detection already provides the
 * genuine ZIP 318 sync/broadcast decoupling in both directions (see that method's doc), so nothing
 * replaces the deleted method — there was no real gap to fill.

     * Implementation note (Rust bridge, 2026-07-10): the Rust `MigrationContext` splits this
     * into three separate steps — `sign_note_split(proposal, usk)` (returns a `PreparedTransfer`:
     * txid + PCZT bytes, nothing broadcast yet), `extract_broadcast_tx(pczt_bytes)` (PCZT →
     * consensus tx bytes), then the SDK's *existing* transaction-submission path (the same one
     * ordinary sends use) to actually broadcast, and finally `record_transfer_result(id, result)`
     * to tell the engine the outcome. This Kotlin method's real implementation composes all four
     * calls and maps the outcome to [TransferResult] — the app only ever sees the single
     * broadcast-and-record round trip.
     *
     * Open question: should this accept NetworkPrivacyOptions?
     * The split is on-chain visible, so routing through Tor may be desirable for
     * large balances. Defaulting to no Tor for simplicity for now.
     *
     * Implementation note (Rust bridge, 2026-07-15): [usk] is required because `sign_note_split`
     * signs the split transaction — sdk-lib never stores or derives a spending key itself, it only
     * ever receives one per-call from the caller, the same boundary
     * [Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions] already establishes for ordinary sends.

         * Deliberately independent of [Synchronizer] — [WalletCoordinator]'s `isSyncBlocked` input
         * needs this *before* any `Synchronizer` exists (a `Synchronizer`-scoped factory would be
         * circular), so this only needs the same inputs [Synchronizer.new] itself takes.
         *
         * [lightWalletEndpoint] should be the same endpoint the app passes to [Synchronizer.new] —
         * there is no independent way for this factory to discover it (wallet/endpoint persistence
         * is an app-layer concern, not an SDK one).
         *
         * [NetworkPrivacyOptions.useTor] uses its own dedicated [cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.internal.model.TorClient]
         * (own on-disk directory, separate from the main `Synchronizer`'s), built lazily on first
         * use — this is a genuinely per-migration setting, independent of the app's global Tor
         * toggle.
         *
         * [account] is the wallet account this instance operates on — whichever account the
         * migration flow is actually running for (the app resolves this, e.g. from the currently
         * selected account; it is never auto-picked here). Pass `null` only for the one legitimate
         * case that has no account selection to make yet: gating [Synchronizer]-independent sync
         * (e.g. [WalletCoordinator]'s `isSyncBlocked` input) before any account is chosen — with a
         * `null` account, [OrchardMigrationSdk.isSyncBlocked] checks every account in the wallet
         * instead of assuming one, and every other method degrades to its "nothing to do" answer
         * or throws (see [cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.internal.OrchardMigrationSdkImpl]'s doc).
